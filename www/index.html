                <p>Appleseed Collective Revival builds from previous efforts to reconnect our urban food network and make use of the abundant food sources in our own community.  The Appleseed Collective is a Working Group of Transition Guelph, picking un-used fruit and nuts from privately owned fruit trees and bushes, mostly in and around the city of Guelph.</p>

                <p>What's new about the Appleseed Collective Revival is that it is a Social Enterprise - that means, along with our community values, and prioritizing the collection of organically-produced fruit and veg, we are attempting to generate revenue that will support and sustain our activities.</p>

                <p>The Appleseed Collective Revival is also looking to expand our database of trees, volunteers, and recipient organizations.  We are looking for members of the public with fruit or nut trees - or vegetables - that could be harvested and / or processed.</p>
